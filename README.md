# Hello Lurker!

You should probably not expect me to know more than you. I am merely a highschooler trying to get some linux experience (I use arch btw) and some embedded stuff. Support is unlikely, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask. I will explain to the best of my ability.

Oh also, the fbtft-overlay thing was pretty cool. I had to decompile fbtft, add overrides for more SPI busses (ones that support DMA and only exist on later models of raspi such as 4 and 5) and recompile! That took me a long time to figure out. Hopefully this helps someone eventually who wants to have multiple fbtft screens despite all the cons.
